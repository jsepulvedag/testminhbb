You must have Microsoft Ajax installed to use this version of the WebControl - without it, it will not function at all.  

If you wish to use Ajax functionality, please download and install Microsoft Ajax for free from the following location:


http://ajax.asp.net/


To use the AJAX control in a standard "ASP.NET WebSite", copy System.Web.Extensions.dll with the assembly into the site's bin.
